# React and Node Assignment for Salary Calculator

The “Salary Calculator: Your Ultimate Wage Companion!” is designed to streamline
your paycheck calculations. This app takes the guesswork out of determining your
salary.
Simply input your basic salary and other income, then the application will do the rest,
factoring in EPF (Employees' Provident Fund), ETF (Employees' Trust Fund), and APIT
(Annual Personal Income Tax). With instant results, you'll have a clear picture of your
take-home pay in seconds.
